    <p>These brown sugar porkchops are a weekly staple in my household, and don't take too long to prepare. The majority of the cook time
        is in the oven, so you can set the timer and move onto other tasks, making this a delicious low-effort meal option.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Brown Sugar – Light brown sugar works best for its subtle caramel-like flavour, which adds gorgeous flavour to the glaze.</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce – The saltiness from the soy sauce balances out the sweetness of the sugar.</li>
        <li>Apple Cider Vinegar – This cuts through both the sweet and salty tones of the glaze.</li>
        <li>Worcestershire Sauce – Offers some depth of flavour.</li>
        <li>Dijon Mustard – Adds some more complexity to the glaze. Plus pork and mustard is a match made in heaven!</li>
        <li>Water – Just thins the sauce out a little (it will evaporate once simmered).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Heat the olive oil in a large oven safe pan over medium high heat.</li>
        <li>Season the pork chops on both sides with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Add the pork chops to the pan in a single layer. Cook for 4 minutes on each side or until browned.</li>
        <li>Remove the pork from the pan and place on a plate. Cover with foil to keep warm.</li>
        <li>Add the butter to the pan and melt. Add the garlic, brown sugar and Italian seasoning and cook for 30 seconds, stirring constantly.</li>
        <li>Place the pork chops back in the pan and spoon the sauce over the top. </li>
        <li>Place the pan in the oven and bake for 10-12 minutes or until pork is cooked to at least 145 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Spoon the sauce from the bottom of the pan over the pork chops and sprinkle with parsley. Serve, garnished with lemon wedges and parsley sprigs if desired.</li>
    </ol>
