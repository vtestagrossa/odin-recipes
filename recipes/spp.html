    <p>This recipe was given to me by my father, who is <em>required</em> to make this for just about every family gathering, since I can remember. 
    When it's done, it's not as pretty as the image, but it tastes amazing and is one of those dishes that becomes even better once it's been refrigerated
    and reheated, making it perfect for leftovers (if there are any). Be careful with the cook time on the potatoes. Depending on how many are 
    in the bowl, 12 minutes will overcook them and they'll become hard. I really recommend microwaving the potatoes because of how differently
    they come out vs. boiling.<p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 package hot italian sausage.</li>
        <li>1 package sweet italian sausage</li>
        <li>2 large green bell Peppers</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper</li>
        <li>1 orange bell pepper</li>
        <li>1 yellow bell pepper</li>
        <li>cajun spice</li>
        <li>8-10 small red Potatoes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the potatoes into 2" cubes, leaving the skins intact and place them into a microwave-safe medium glass bowl.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and cook on high for about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the potatoes are cooking, brown the sausage in a large skillet (cast iron is best) on medium heat, covered.</li>
        <li>Cut the peppers into thin strips while the sausage is browning and set them aside for now.</li>
        <li>When the sausage is browned, cut the sausage back into the skillet (I recommend using cooking scissors and tongs for this) and then mix in the slices of peppers.</li>
        <li>Add a liberal amount of cajun spice, stir it together, and put the lid back on it.</li>
        <li>Using oven mits, remove the bowl from the microwave and remove the plastic wrap from the bowl, making sure to open from the side furthest from you with your oven mits still on (there <em>will</em> be steam!).</li>
        <li>Use a spatula or a spoon to scoop the potatoes from the bowl into the skillet, then stir the mixture together and add some more cajun spice. You want enough to slightly change the color of the entire mixture.</li>
        <li>Cover the skillet again and test the softness of the peppers occasionally, stirring in some more cajun spice as you do. This step should take about 30 minutes on medium heat.</li>
        <li>Once the peppers have no more "snap" left, the dish is done. Allow to stand for 3-5 minutes uncovered. </li>
    </ol>
