            As I get older, I need a convenient place to store my recipes that isn't going to get lost in a cabinet somewhere. I decided
            to make this page in order to catelog some of them for quick access, while also learning some more modern CSS, HTML, and JS 
            plus some frameworks and libraries. I'm using TheOdinProject to learn and develop my skills and I will likely make something a
            little more dynamic in the coming weeks. Maybe this will turn into yet another blog. Who knows?
